## Presentation
<p>
3D mock-up representing an interactive installation within the Saint-Lazare metro station, in Paris, and raising awareness of violence and harassment in public places, in particular transport area. The installation puts several passers-by in a situation of aggression against which it is possible for them to act collectively to arrest the aggressor.
</p>
<p>
This mock-up was produced with the P5 library. This project is an initiative resulting from a lecture about interactivity, at the IMAC engineering school.
</p>

Realized in May 2020.
